sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes very long on all given numbers.txt

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: The results come in super fast. The divide and conquer method just works best especially on the reversed.txt

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It's the only one left and takes even longer than bubble sort.
